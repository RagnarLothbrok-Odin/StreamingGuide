# MDBList Account

MDBList is the main catalog provider in AIOMetadata. Without it, catalogs won’t appear.

## Create Your Account

- Open [MDBList signup](https://mdblist.com/signin) and create an account

## Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Preferences](https://mdblist.com/preferences/) → scroll to **API Access**
2. Copy the key—you’ll paste it into [AIOMetadata](/addons/aiometadata) (Integrations tab)
