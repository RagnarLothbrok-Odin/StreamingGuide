# Setup Guide

Welcome. This guide gets you to a fast, reliable setup on **Nuvio**, **Omni**, or **Stremio**. Pick one app; the addons are the same.

:::: tip Same addons
All three apps use the same addons. You pick one app, create the accounts that app needs, then follow the same addon setup.
::::

## What you'll do

- **Install your app** → [Nuvio](/install/nuvio) · [Omni](/install/omni) · [Stremio](/install/stremio)
- **Accounts** - Debrid, TMDB, TVDB, etc. (for addons)
- **Core addons** - Install the same set for discovery, metadata, and streaming
- **Configuration** - Import copy‑paste configs for filters and formatting

:::: warning About preferences
This guide reflects an everyday setup that prioritizes quality and speed. Preferences differ; you can always diverge once you understand the moving parts.
