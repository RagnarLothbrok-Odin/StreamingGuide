# Choose your app

This guide works for **Nuvio**, **Omni**, and **Stremio**. All three use the same Stremio addons; only the app you install is different.

Pick your app and follow its install steps:

- **[Nuvio](/install/nuvio)** — Android & iOS (TestFlight, AltStore, SideStore)
- **[Omni](/install/omni)** — Apple TV, iPhone, iPad (App Store)
- **[Stremio](/install/stremio)** — Desktop, mobile & web (official app)

After you’ve installed your app and signed in with your Stremio account, continue with the full setup:

→ **[Continue to setup guide](/overview)** (accounts, addons, configuration)
